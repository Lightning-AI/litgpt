We are both non-native English speakers. He claimed that I used it as a foul or slang term. I vehemently disagreed with him about it. I told him that the word 'suck' can be used to describe something inefficient or not good enough as well like it is used in the example 'Samsung mobile sucks'. Am I right to describe the use of the word 'suck' in such context?.",

How it's regarded or received might be generational. I typed is suck vulgar? on Google, and found mixed responses. Feel free to do the same if you want diverse opinions on the matter. I thought this excerpt from a blog post, though, was worth pasting into an answer here: Some may not believe this, but suck as in 'Man, this class sucks' was also in the raw obscenity category when I was a teenager. It was used plenty in the school hallways but not in front of your teacher and never in front of your mother. I remember some agitation by certain culturally-advanced youngsters who tried to railroad their elders into accepting sucks as a safe and harmless substitute for stinks. The elders weren't having any of it, last I checked, but the liberalizing linguists seem to have carried the day. I have always assumedrightly or wrongly, I do not know that the word was originally intended to carry sexual overtones, which was the reason for its suppression. Today, the sexual overtones are either forgotten or are now acceptable in mixed company. I'm not sure which explanation disturbs me more. I think you and your friend are unlikely to come up with an agreed-upon viewpoint, because you're both right in a way.

    "output": "BeeHighve CEO Rita Hall intends to bring Newfoundland honey and honey-based products to the market, some infused with cannabis, while others will be \"buzz free.\"\nA selection of some of the products available from Corner Brook, N.L.-based BeeHighve Inc.\nThere's a lot of buzz around a joint venture between two Newfoundland companies that want to bring cannabis-infused honey and honey products to local and global markets.\nBeeHighve Inc., based in Corner Brook, will be cultivating the cannabis crop, while G and M Family Farms, near Placentia, will supply the honey.\n\"It ranges from pure honey to sauces as well as chocolate and health bars, and everything is organic,\" said BeeHighve CEO Rita Hall. \"And everything is very healthy for you. We don't use sugar in our products.\"\nThe partnership is the brainchild of Hall, a trailblazer who is on track to become the first Indigenous woman to gain licensed producer [of marijuana] status in Canada, as well as one of the country's few Indigenous female CEOs.\nHall intends for Newfoundland honey to be the backbone of her operation, and utilizes it in all the products, including the flagship Nuts About Honey bars.\nAlthough no official date has been set for the legalization of cannabis-infused edibles \u2014 with recreational marijuana use legal as of Oct. 17, 2018 \u2014 BeeHighve plans to produce the same line of products, without the cannabis elements before and after the legalization of edibles.\n\"I don't think it's going to have a negative impact on the business at all. The honey is really generating a lot of interest,\" Hall said.\nPart of the interest is because of Newfoundland's uniquely thriving honey-bee population, who enjoy the benefits of a closed ecosystem comparatively free from mites and diseases associated with colony collapse.\n\"They love the idea of mite-free, antibiotic-free honey. So I have no doubt that the production and sale of honey and the consumables without cannabis infusions will go very well.\"\nEventually BeeHighve intends to get into the beekeeping business as well, allowing them to produce larger volumes of product in less time.\nAside from the plans to export the cannabis-infused products \u2014 where legal \u2014 as well as the \"buzz-free\" ones globally, BeeHighve is looking to expand its production to another province.\nPartnering with the Madawaska Maliseet First Nation reserve in New Brunswick, crops will be cultivated on the reserve to later be infused with Newfoundland honey. Hall believes the partnership will be a fruitful one, and has great respect for the Madawaska Maliseet, whose senior leadership is entirely made of women.\n\"It shows the strength of women in any marketplace. Women are really underrepresented in the cannabis industry right now, so it's, I'll say, a feather in our caps, no pun intended, to be a part of this industry as well.\"\nHall has just as much faith in this venture as the one in Newfoundland.\n\"We're very strong women and I think very successful, and we'll succeed at this as well.\"",

    "input": "How to deal with non negotiable change\n\nOne of the issues my organisation has is where change requests are requested during a sprint cycle in a particular high volume worksteam. The development team are often forced to accept these change requests, where any resistance results in an escalation, which results with somebody high up in the business just telling the dev team to do it. Thus, team is constantly over-committing every sprint cycle.\nI have highlighted this as an issue to Senior management, showing the impact the additional work is having on morale and quality, but nothing seems to be changing at org level, and they seem to think the problem is at team level. Hence, keep trying to address the issue by adding and removing Scrum Masters; where they all are having the same problem.\nWhat is the best way to address this?\n\nA:\n\nTL;DR\nYou have both a political problem and a process problem. There is no silver bullet, and you can't fix these problems solely within the team. Instead, you must rely on the agile concepts of transparency and visibility to ensure that the costs associated with bypassing the process are charged to the project budget.\nMake Costs Visible\nIn agile frameworks, change is never non-negotiable. If you are faced with \"non-negotiable\" requirements that make the goal or plan for the current iteration obsolete, then the team must scrap the plan.\nThis is true regardless of the agile framework you're using. In Scrum, the Product Owner cancels the Sprint and the Scrum Team returns to Sprint Planning. In Kanban, work is pulled off the board to meet work-in-progress (WIP) limits, and queued in the appropriate bucket until capacity is once again available. Your specific framework may vary in the way it implements this freeing up of capacity, but it's an essential component of any viable agile (and even non-agile) process.\nThe cost of replanning and re-queuing is made visible through metrics such as cycle time, cumulative flow, velocity, burn-down, or other framework- and implementation-specific metrics. Communicating about these costs is also essential. By presenting the data to stakeholders and company officers, you place the responsibility for those costs squarely where it belongs.\nSchedule risk (like any risk) can be accepted, transferred, or mitigated. Which of these three options is best is a business decision, not a team decision. Regardless of the choice, senior management owns both the choice and the outcome.\nSee Also\nhttps://pm.stackexchange.com/a/10829/4271",
    "output": "I agree with Todd about it being a political and process problem.\nI want to add that apart from showing them the impact on morale and quality -which I believe that they are quite important for your team- I would recommend having a discussion with them to understand why they believe it is useful to have this way of working and also prepare for them a \"business case\" that explores what is they key impact of this way of working for the senior management (trying to talk their own language basically). \nMost of the times, this comes down to how much money they are losing by having this way of working. Examples of the impact to senior management are:\n\nDelayed features due to the introduction of these changes \nBugs introduced due to quality issues that required to introduce more tasks in future releases.",

    "input": "Use of LaTeX commands\n\nIt appears that LaTeX commands cannot be used on SE Linguistics, but they can on other SE sites. Personally, I wanted to use this feature a number of times to insert a formula and here's another question with the same problem. Expressing formulae can be useful when discussing things as simple as the number of combinations that arise from the different conditions in an experiment, or when discussing statistics questions relevant to linguistics. \nCould we please allow the use of LaTeX commands? I don't think having this feature will be a problem for anyone not wanting to use it and it will help those who do.\n\nA:\n\nAbsolutely subscribing here!\nI am surprised that this is not a feature already, I am really missing TeX support - for a wide range of uses that I consider essential in the field of linguistics:  \n\nMathematical formulas.\nAs someone who frequently answers questions on formal semantics, like here, here and here, I feel that answering (and asking) these questions in the current state is a mess, to an extent where it has sometimes kept me from writing answers to those questions altogether, simply because the process of setting them up is so annoying.\nWhile I am aware that there are tools which ease the inclusion of Unicode symbols as HTML, all of these solutions (at least the ones I am aware of) still make typing more than one line of math quite cumbersome given that every symbol has to be clicked on individually, but worse than that, many characters and necessary formatting options, like pretty much half of the inventory I needed in this linguistically originated question, aren't even available as predefined Unicode symbols at all. Not to mention the fact that the output is visually not particularly pleasing and often makes the question hard to read, as can well be seen in this post.\nBesides, I doubt that the average user is aware of the existence of such tools; it took me more than a year on SE to find out about these, while new users have repeatedly been asking for LaTeX support, because this what users are used to.\nApart from formulas for questions on logic, MathJax would prove useful in questions involving statistics or combinatorics, which time and time again turn up this site.  \nIPA, as already discussed here and here, to frequently be used in posts like here, here, here and many posts by other users.\nAt this point I am not sure whether enabling MathJax will also provide the opportunity to support other LaTeX packages, but if so, being able to use tipa would be of great help in typing IPA symbols.\nI am aware of IPA typeit which I have used so far, and some other external tools, but again, clicking is cumbersome, and users will be more comfortable writing questions and answers with the tools thy are used to (and the standard way of typesetting IPA symbols is LaTeX tipa).     \nOther, less urgent cases where I could imagine TeX support to be useful - again under the premise that support for special packages is in principal possible - include\n\ntree structures, most importantly syntax trees, like here, here and here; a similar request was already made on meta here.\nlinguistic example formatting, which I could have used here, and interlinear glosses for posts like here, which are rather inconvenient to do appropriately without automatic alignment.\nThe current solution to these use cases is to typeset them externally and then include them in the post via a screenshot - I could live with this solution for these particular cases, but if MathJax comes, then this would certainly be a nice for these less frequent use cases as well.  \n\nA:\n\nIt won't be a problem, but we need to show that the site actually needs it. \nOn Physics SE, the same question has been asked and you can see it got at least 32 votes. If there is not enough support from the community, which means enough people that want it, then it's probably not gonna happen. It's the same as for Migration paths in other sites, you need to prove there is a case for it to be implemented.\nIf it gets enough support, it'll be added. ",

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Sequestration Relief Act of 2013''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Congress must enact a comprehensive, deficit reduction \n        plan to solve the country's fiscal challenges and to promote \n        national security, economic stability, and the continued growth \n        and prosperity of the United States.\n            (2) The keys to a comprehensive, deficit reduction solution \n        are increased revenues and changes in mandatory spending.\n            (3) The Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted to avert a \n        default on Federal debt obligations, and it reduced \n        discretionary spending by approximately $1 trillion through \n        fiscal year 2021.\n            (4) Because the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction \n        failed to recommend legislation providing an additional $1.2 \n        trillion in deficit reduction, Federal law mandates that the \n        additional savings be sequestered.\n            (5) Sequestration was designed as a forcing mechanism for \n        an agreement on a comprehensive, deficit reduction plan. It has \n        failed to produce the intended results.\n            (6) It no longer makes sense to rely on sequestration as a \n        forcing mechanism for a balanced solution. The costs to our \n        government and to the economy are too great.\n            (7) Under sequestration, automatic, indiscriminate cuts \n        would be applied, through fiscal year 2021, to a wide variety \n        of discretionary spending programs to achieve $1.2 trillion in \n        savings, forestalling the sound planning needed for prudent and \n        meaningful investments in national security, the workforce, \n        transportation infrastructure, education, health care, public \n        safety, housing, innovation, small business development, and \n        many other facets of enduring national strength.\n            (8) Even the prospect of sequestration is disruptive to \n        regular order and to the congressional appropriations process, \n        and it fosters damaging economic uncertainty, while short-term \n        solutions only suspend the prospect and continue to undermine \n        the certainty needed for economic recovery.\n            (9) Therefore, Congress must eliminate the threat of \n        sequestration.\n            (10) Given the magnitude of the Federal deficit, it is \n        likely that additional cuts to discretionary spending will be \n        necessary for a comprehensive deficit reduction solution.\n            (11) Congress must establish a manageable, long-term \n        discretionary spending plan. An additional $320 billion in \n        targetable cuts to discretionary appropriations from fiscal \n        year 2014 through fiscal year 2021 represents one-third of the \n        net amount that would have been indiscriminately cut by \n        sequestration over fiscal years 2013 through 2021.\n            (12) It is recognized that a reduction of $167 billion to \n        discretionary appropriations within budget function 050 from \n        fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2021 will affect the \n        National Military Strategy.

    "output": "Sequestration Relief Act of 2013 - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Controlled Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), as amended by the Budget Control Act of 2011, to repeal automatic sequestration to enforce a specified budget goal. Reduces the discretionary spending limits for security and nonsecurity categories by $320 billion for FY2014-FY2021. Confines the current meaning of &quot;security category&quot; under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act to FY2012-FY2013. Revises the definition of &quot;security category&quot; for FY2014-FY2021 to mean discretionary appropriations in all of budget function 050 (national defense). Amends the No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013 to suspend through January 31, 2017, the current $16.394 trillion public debt limit. Postpones until February 1, 2017, an automatic increase in the public debt limit to the extent that: (1) the face amount of obligations issued and the face amount of obligations whose principal and interest are guaranteed by the federal government (except guaranteed obligations held by the Secretary of the Treasury) outstanding on February 1, 2017, exceeds (2) the face amount of such obligations outstanding on the date of enactment of the No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013 (February 24, 2013). Prohibits an obligation from being taken into account unless its issuance was necessary to fund a commitment incurred by the federal government that required payment before February 1, 2017.",
