    "input": "What is the purpose of consciousness?",
    "output": "Cardiff University and University College London provide funding as founding partners of The Conversation UK.\nMost experts think that consciousness can be divided into two parts: the experience of consciousness (or personal awareness), and the contents of consciousness, which include things such as thoughts, beliefs, sensations, perceptions, intentions, memories and emotions.\nIt\u2019s easy to assume that these contents of consciousness are somehow chosen, caused or controlled by our personal awareness \u2013 after all, thoughts don\u2019t exist until until we think them. But in a new research paper in Frontiers of Psychology, we argue that this is a mistake.\nWe suggest that our personal awareness does not create, cause or choose our beliefs, feelings or perceptions. Instead, the contents of consciousness are generated \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d by fast, efficient, non-conscious systems in our brains. All this happens without any interference from our personal awareness, which sits passively in the passenger seat while these processes occur.\nPut simply, we don\u2019t consciously choose our thoughts or our feelings \u2013 we become aware of them.\nIf this sounds strange, consider how effortlessly we regain consciousness each morning after losing it the night before; how thoughts and emotions \u2013 welcome or otherwise \u2013 arrive already formed in our minds; how the colours and shapes we see are constructed into meaningful objects or memorable faces without any effort or input from our conscious mind.\nConsider that all the neuropsychological processes responsible for moving your body or using words to form sentences take place without involving your personal awareness. We believe that the processes responsible for generating the contents of consciousness do the same.\nOur thinking has been influenced by research into neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as more recent cognitive neuroscience studies using hypnosis. The studies using hypnosis show that a person\u2019s mood, thoughts and perceptions can be profoundly altered by suggestion.\nIn such studies, participants go through a hypnosis induction procedure, to help them to enter a mentally focused and absorbed state. Then, suggestions are made to change their perceptions and experiences.\nFor example, in one study, researchers recorded the brain activity of participants when they raised their arm intentionally, when it was lifted by a pulley, and when it moved in response to a hypnotic suggestion that it was being lifted by a pulley.\nSimilar areas of the brain were active during the involuntary and the suggested \u201calien\u201d movement, while brain activity for the intentional action was different. So, hypnotic suggestion can be seen as a means of communicating an idea or belief that, when accepted, has the power to alter a person\u2019s perceptions or behaviour.\nAll this may leave one wondering where our thoughts, emotions and perceptions actually come from. We argue that the contents of consciousness are a subset of the experiences, emotions, thoughts and beliefs that are generated by non-conscious processes within our brains.\nThis subset takes the form of a personal narrative, which is constantly being updated. The personal narrative exists in parallel with our personal awareness, but the latter has no influence over the former.\nThe personal narrative is important because it provides information to be stored in your autobiographical memory (the story you tell yourself, about yourself), and gives human beings a way of communicating the things we have perceived and experienced to others.\nThis, in turn, allows us to generate survival strategies; for example, by learning to predict other people\u2019s behaviour. Interpersonal skills like this underpin the development of social and cultural structures, which have promoted the survival of human kind for millennia.\nSo, we argue that it is the ability to communicate the contents of one\u2019s personal narrative \u2013\u2013 and not personal awareness \u2013 that gives humans their unique evolutionary advantage.\nIf the experience of consciousness does not confer any particular advantage, it\u2019s not clear what its purpose is. But as a passive accompaniment to non-conscious processes, we don\u2019t think that the phenomenon of personal awareness has a purpose, in much the same way that rainbows do not. Rainbows simply result from the reflection, refraction and dispersion of sunlight through water droplets \u2013 none of which serves any particular purpose.\nOur conclusions also raise questions about the notions of free will and personal responsibility. If our personal awareness does not control the contents of the personal narrative which reflects our thoughts, feelings, emotions, actions and decisions, then perhaps we should not be held responsible for them.\nIn response to this, we argue that free will and personal responsibility are notions that have been constructed by society. As such, they are built into the way we see and understand ourselves as individuals, and as a species. Because of this, they are represented within the non-conscious processes that create our personal narratives, and in the way we communicate those narratives to others.\nJust because consciousness has been placed in the passenger seat, does not mean we need to dispense with important everyday notions such as free will and personal responsibility. In fact, they are embedded in the workings of our non-conscious brain systems. They have a powerful purpose in society and have a deep impact on the way we understand ourselves.",

    "output": "Which way should you pass the plates? How should you clear the table? Serving at a dinner party isn't exactly as easy as pie. Here are some basic guidelines to help you out in your next dinner party.\n1. Steamed or roasted vegetables, rice, salad, potatoes, and condiments are some of the things you can usually leave in the middle of the table for guests to help themselves to. This isn't strictly necessary, though. If you prefer to keep things simple, you don't have to leave anything more than salt and pepper on the table.\n2. This is known as \"plating-up.\" Don't expect guests to help themselves to food that requires assembly or is difficult to manage. The only way they'll get to see your creativity is if you put it out on the plate for them before you even get to the dinner table.\nKeep the rim of the plate clear of sauces, spills, anything; it frames the food.\n3. You can do this if you want to keep with tradition and the occasion is quite formal. Otherwise, choose one end of the table and move around it in a clockwise fashion, regardless of the genders of your guests.\n\nPass all dishes from the left. Guests and servers should pass dishes from left. The logic behind this is that most people are right-handed and this allows them them to serve themselves from the dish while it is being held by the passer. Nowadays it is less likely that the passer will continue to hold the dish, but will expect you to take it, so if you are left-handed, it won't be a problem. Place the dish down on your side plate to serve from it.\n\nAs the cook, or host, always serve yourself last. This is polite and also sensible, since you'll probably be busy anyway with host's duties.\n4. They'll get fidgety, anxious and gossipy about what you're doing.\n5. On the other hand, do not ever go into details about how the flesh portion of the meal was hunted/killed. This is bad taste and makes some guests very queasy. Leave it for discussion around the fireplace with a like-minded friend after dinner.\n6. The host or hired help should clear no more than two plates at a time to avoid bumping guests and interfering with their eating. There is nothing more annoying than the server's elbows in your face when you're just about to take the next bite.\n7. Preferably the noises should not reach the guests but this is unrealistic for most homes. Just do it as quietly as possible and try not to clank, crack, break or drop the dishes. The last thing you need on top of anything else is a dropped plate to clean up.\n8. This means all the dishes on the table, the condiments and the side plates. If you haven't already set out the dessert spoons, this is the time to do so.\n9. Chocolates will have their own method of getting around the table; it has been suspected they have legs...\n10. Don't take advantage of the situation because that guest is there to enjoy himself too but don't hesitate to ask for a quick hand with a simple task that won't risk spills on their clothes.\n",
